/**
 * @class BinaryHeap
 * @classdesc One important variation of a queue is called a priority queue.
 * A priority queue acts like a queue in that you dequeue an item by removing
 * it from the front. However, in a priority queue the logical
 * order of items inside a queue is determined by their priority.
 * The highest priority items are at the front of the queue and the
 * lowest priority items are at the back.
 * Thus when you enqueue an item on a priority queue,
 * the new item may move all the way to the front.<br/>
 *<br/>
 * The classic way to implement a priority queue is using a data structure
 * called a binary heap. A binary heap will allow us both enqueue
 * and dequeue items in O(log n).
 *<br/>
 *
 * In our heap implementation we keep the tree balanced by creating a complete binary tree<br/>
 * Another interesting property of a complete tree is that we can represent it
 * using a single list. We
 * do not need to use nodes and references or even lists of lists. Because the tree is complete, the
 * left child of a parent (at position p) is the node that is found in position 2p in the list.
 * Similarly, the right child of the parent is at position 2p+1 in the list. To find the parent
 * of any node in the tree, we can simply use Javascriptâ€™s integer division. Given that a node is at
 * position nn in the list, the parent is at position n/2.
 * <br/>
 * <br/>
 * The binary heap has two common variations: the min heap,
 * in which the smallest key is always at the front,
 * and the max heap, in which the largest key value is always at the front.<br/>
 * BinaryHeap() creates a new, empty, binary heap.<br/>
 * insert(k) adds a new item to the heap.<br/>
 * findMin() returns the item with the minimum key value,
 * leaving item in the heap.<br/>
 * delMin() returns the item with the minimum key value, removing
 * the item from the heap.<br/>
 * isEmpty() returns true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.<br/>
 * size() returns the number of items in the heap.<br/>
 * buildHeap(list) builds a new heap from a list of keys.

   * operations. However, remember that inserting an item in the middle of the list may require
   * O(n) operations to shift the rest of the list over to make room for the new key. Therefore,
   * to insert n keys into the heap would require a total of O(n log n) operations. However,
   * if we start with an entire list then we can build the whole heap in O(n) operations.
